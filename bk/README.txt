### Miter Saw Timeline Project (Pixel Perfect V3)

How to run:
1. Double click `start_server.py` (or run `python start_server.py` in terminal).
2. It will start a local server at port 8081 and open your browser.
3. Address: http://localhost:8081/index.html

Troubleshooting:
- If data is empty: Ensure you are running via the server, NOT opening index.html directly from file explorer.
- Browser Security: Modern browsers block CSV loading from local files (file://). You MUST use the python server.

Updates:
- UI rewritten to match user screenshot (3-Column Layout, Dual Desc Boxes).
- CSV Data patched with latest Bosch report content (2005-2025).
